## Features

- Navigation 

On the top left of the page, there is a Coding Club logo that is a link to the homepage.

To the right of the logo there are four navigation links: Why Coding Club?, Sign up, Contact us and Find us. These links are for the user of the website to easily find the information they are looking for. The navigation links changes color when the user hovers over each link making it clear to the user that they are clickable.

- The "Reasons to choose us" Section

The Reasons to choose us section is the first section the user sees when scrolling down on the website, this is to show the user what Coding Club has to offer and provides the user with information about the member community and course material. 

- The Sign Up Section 

This Section provides the user with pricing information and the ability to sign up for the course. The user is presented with a form where they can provide details such as: Parent's/Guardian's name, Child's name, Contact Email. The user can also choose a preferred starting date to join Coding Club. The section includes a submit button colored green in order to make it stick out from the rest of the website as a clear call to action for the user. The background of this section is in black color in order to reduce cognitive overload while structuring the different sections for UX. 

- The Contact Us Section 

The Contact Us Section provides the user with a textarea field where they can ask questions directly to Coding Club and get a response through email.
This section is very valuable to both the user and Coding Club because many potential Coding Club members may have questions about the course material or the company in general before joining the course. This provides the users to get in contact with Coding Club before making a decision while also giving the Coding Club staff a chance to secure potential members.

- The Find Us Here Section

This Section provides the user with an iframes map overviewing the location of the company, the map is generated by Google Map HTML Generator making it interactable and updated with nearby restuarants and other locations which might be factors that the users takes into consideration when making a decision about joining the course.
